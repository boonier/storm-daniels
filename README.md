# Storm Daniels

This is a demo of using realtime tweets of a certain hashtag, to drive an audio/visual experience about a certain personality, and the storm surrounding them!

It's based on a Node/Express backend to serve the Twitter realtime stream to a Websocket server. The front-end opens a Websocket connection and it goes from there.

## Get started

To install `npm install` or ` yarn`

To start up the server `npm start` or `yarn start`

Then point the browser to `localhost:3000`

### TIPs! 
Use the mouse or trackpad (and L/R click) to look around...scroll works as well
